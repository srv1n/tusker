# Schema canon

## Read this when

Read this for the current model, invariants, defaults, and boundaries for schema.

## Do not read this when

Do not use this as task proof; open linked tasks only when implementation history or evidence matters.

## Current model

This domain records current durable truth for schema.

## Invariants

- Keep current truth in domain knowledge pages.
- Keep task proof in `tusker/epics/**`.
- Prefer source code over prose when exact behavior conflicts.

## Current defaults

- New knowledge starts as draft canon until verified.
- Route through this canon before opening historical tasks.

## Deprecated behavior

- Do not treat task files as canonical documentation.

## Source of truth

- `tusker/SKILL.md`

## Open questions

- Add domain-specific open questions here as the implementation matures.
