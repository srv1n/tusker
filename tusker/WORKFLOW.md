## Routing

You are working on {{ note.id }} for {{ project.name }}. Dispatch only makes sense because this task is currently {{ note.status }} and the workspace is ready at {{ workspace.path }}.

## Prompt

Use the installed Tusker skill bundle for durable task semantics, evidence, and verification discipline. Work inside {{ workspace.path }}. Treat {{ repo.root }} as the source repository root for context only unless the task explicitly requires comparing against it.

Item: {{ note.title }}
Record: {{ note.record_id }}
Type: {{ note.type }}
Attempt: {{ attempt.number }}
Workflow: {{ workflow.path }}
Vault: {{ vault.path }}

## Completion contract

When the work is demonstrably ready for verification, move the task to `review`. If the work is blocked, set status to `blocked` with a concrete blocker instead of exiting cleanly. If the task remains active after a turn, the daemon will continue or retry the same session.

## Retry policy

Retry only transient infrastructure failures. Human-directed rework creates a new active task revision.

## Human override policy

Humans may edit tasks directly, but runtime state belongs to the daemon store.
